Eight works will be selected by the jury and their teams will each receive a prize.<br/>
The total award fund for the competition amounts to 8000 &euro; and will be split in the following way:
<ul>
<li>The first prize will be 4000 &euro;.</li>
<li>The second prize will be 2000 &euro;.</li>
<li>The third prize will be 1000 &euro;.</li>
<li>The remaining 5 prizes will be a 200 &euro; Amazon Gift Card.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: x-small">
Note: a person cannot win two or more prizes. If the same person results in two winning teams, the smaller prize will not be awarded to that team. So the suggestion is that if you plan to participate with more than our submission, you do it with the same team.

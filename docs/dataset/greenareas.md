Madrid is a very green city and the city is full of spaces.


Among the cartographic data made available by the Municipality of Madrid there are the green areas for each district.


You can find the data on this page
[Cartograf√≠a municipal por distritos a escala 1: 1000, SHP format, ETRS89](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=a4f36d34fa86c410VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default)

The resource is a set of zip files (one for each district of Madrid) which each contain several layers in ESRI Shapefile format.
A description for each layer contained in the zip archives of each district,in spanish language, is available in the file [cartografia-distritos-1-1000.csv](https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/213565-0-cartografia-distritos-1-1000.csv)

Madrid is recognized a '[Tree City of the World 2019](https://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Medio-ambiente/Parques-y-jardines/Madrid-reconocida-Ciudad-arborea-del-mundo-2019-por-la-FAO-y-la-Fundacion-Arbor-Day/?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=3cdf84fec1732710VgnVCM2000001f4a900aRCRD&vgnextchannel=2ba279ed268fe410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD)' by FAO and the Arbor Day Foundation 

The municipality manages over 655,000 trees.

Information about each of these trees is available such as:
- height
- trunk diameter
- crown diameter
- species and genus
- geographic coordinates
- ...

Trees produce so many benefits and this is important information to know.

This is one of the most important datasets for our challenge.

The dataset contains all the trees managed by the Municipality, excluding trees in parks and gardens, areas of property or areas of recent construction not yet received by the Municipality.
<br/><br/>
You can obtain the dataset in csv format with the coordinates in latitude and longitude by downloading the file [tress_madrid.zip](https://github.com/greemta/greemta/raw/main/data/green/trees_madrid.zip) (61Mb) (last update 15/11/2020).


You can also access the file from the ArcGIS Catalog via RestAPI from this end point [http://sigma.madrid.es/arcgismalla/rest/services/MTMOV](http://sigma.madrid.es/arcgismalla/rest/services/MTMOV)

The end-point [http://sigma.madrid.es/arcgismalla/rest/services/MTMOV/MPUAUA/FeatureServer](http://sigma.madrid.es/arcgismalla/rest/services/MTMOV/MPUAUA/FeatureServer) contains additional attributes

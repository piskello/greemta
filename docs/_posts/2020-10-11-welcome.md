# Welcome to the Greemta Challenge
## what'is Greemta
Trees represent an important heritage for the ecological sustainability of the city of the future.
Madrid has been recognized as one of the most arboreal cities in the world. The care of the green spaces of Madrid is an asset that everyone must learn. The purpose of Greemta is to enhance, through data, all the urban green heritage of the city by returning its economic and social value through interactive graphics, analyzes and infographics aimed at being understood by everyone.
Greemta's outputs will be to create greater awareness of the trees of the city and to provide tools for anyone to be reused.
With this we want to stimulate the other cities to imitate Madrid and to private individuals to open a dialogue with the public in the management of green areas.

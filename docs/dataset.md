The data competition is about green and Madrid so we have prepared some datasets for you to start with. However you can and are invited to use more and different datasets if you think they will make your work more interesting.

We have prepared the following datasets:
* [trees](trees)
* [green areas](greenareas)
* [administrative divisions of the city](administrativeunits)
* ADD_MORE!

Some pointers to other resources where you might find more datasets or inspirations:
* The [open data portal of Madrid](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/) (in Spanish, "Portal de datos abiertos del Ayuntamiento de Madrid").
* [Map of the trees of Madrid](http://www-2.munimadrid.es/DGPVE_WUAUA/welcome.do) (in Spanish, "Un alcorque, un árbol. Madrid más verde"). It displays on a map data very similar to the dataset of trees that we shared above.
* [Geoportal of Madrid](https://geoportal.madrid.es/IDEAM_WBGEOPORTAL/visor_ide.iam)
* [ArcGis server of Madrid](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?featurecollection=https%3A%2F%2Fsigma.madrid.es%2Farcgismalla%2Frest%2Fservices%3Ff%3Djson%26option%3Dfootprints&supportsProjection=true&supportsJSONP=true) (see also the [ArcGis Rest service directory](http://sigma.madrid.es/arcgismalla/rest/services))

The data competition is about green and Madrid so we have prepared some datasets for you to start with. However you can and are invited to use more and different datasets if you think they will make your work more interesting.

We have prepared the following datasets:
* [trees](trees)
* [green areas](greenareas)

Dataset as support for your investigations
* [administrative divisions of the city](administrativeunits)
* [climate](climate)
* [infrastructures](infrastructures)
* [statistic data](statisticsdata)


All the data is provided from the Madrid City Council and you can find also on the [open data portal of Madrid](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/).<br/>
We reorganized the data in CSV and GeoJSON to help you to reduce your time to work.<br/>


The data is open data and is licensed under these conditions<br/>

Reuse is understood to be the use of documents held by the Madrid City Council, provided that such use doesn't constitute a public administrative activity. (...) For example, authorized reuse includes activities such as copying, disseminating, modifying, adapting, extracting, rearranging, and combining information."*

* [Map of the trees of Madrid](http://www-2.munimadrid.es/DGPVE_WUAUA/welcome.do) (in Spanish, "Un alcorque, un árbol. Madrid más verde"). It displays on a map data very similar to the dataset of trees that we shared above.
